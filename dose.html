        <h2>What Can I Control?</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 11, 2025</div>
            <p>Life has a way of throwing curveballs, doesn’t it? One moment, everything feels fine, and the next, you’re hit with a storm you never saw coming. We’ve all been there—whether it's the sudden loss of something or someone important, an unexpected failure, or simply the chaotic nature of living in a world that’s always shifting. And in these moments, it’s easy to fall into the trap of trying to control things that, frankly, are beyond our grasp.</p>
            <p>But here’s the thing: In order to love yourself, you can't hate the experiences that shaped you. When things feel out of control, the immediate instinct is to either fight the chaos or ignore it. Yet, it’s often the very chaos, the uncontrollable events, and the hardships that shape us into who we’re supposed to be. These things are part of the process of becoming.</p>
            <p>I’m not saying it’s easy. Trust me, I’ve struggled with this. In the past, I wanted to control everything—the outcomes, the reactions, the way others saw me. But the more I tried to hold onto control, the more I realized: control, in the sense we’re often taught, doesn’t exist. You can’t control the universe, you can’t control people, and you can’t control the circumstances of your life. But what you can control is how you respond to them, how you process them, and how you grow from them.</p>
            <p>Carl Jung once said, "I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become." That quote has stuck with me because it speaks to the idea that we are not defined by our circumstances or what’s beyond our reach. We are defined by what we choose to make of those experiences.</p>
            <p>In my life, I’ve been through moments where everything felt out of control—whether it was unexpected challenges in my personal life or moments where I faced failures I didn’t see coming. But the truth is, in those moments, I learned that I could control how I responded. I could decide whether to let those challenges break me or let them build me. I could either focus on what I couldn’t control or invest my energy into what I could—my mindset, my decisions, and my actions.</p>
            <p>You see, life is unpredictable, and no amount of worrying or trying to steer the ship will change that. But the real power lies in choosing how to face the storm. It’s about accepting that some things are beyond your grasp and learning to be at peace with that. It’s about realizing that your response is your superpower.</p>
            <p>As humans, we’re wired to want control, and it’s easy to get lost in the desire to fix everything. But sometimes, the best thing you can do is to stop trying to control what you can’t. Stop obsessing over the things that are out of your hands and focus on your own growth. Ask yourself, "How can I grow through this? What can I learn from this experience? How can I control my response?"</p>
            <p>That’s when you realize: You don’t need to control everything. You only need to control yourself—the way you think, the way you act, and the way you treat others.</p>
            <p>Jung’s teachings remind us that it’s not about having the power to shape everything around us. Instead, it’s about embracing the things we can’t control and finding peace in them. The key to navigating this chaotic world is learning to focus on our own internal growth.</p>
            <p>Life will always throw curveballs. But when you learn to control your reactions, your perspective, and your approach, you start to unlock a new level of power and peace. You begin to understand that true control is found not in the external world, but in the way you engage with it.</p>
