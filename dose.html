        <h2>The Power of the Unseen</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 7, 2025</div>
            <p>Most people don’t realize how much their daily choices shape their future. They wait for some huge breakthrough, some defining moment that will change their life overnight. But that’s not how real growth happens. It’s not the big things—it’s the small, consistent actions you take every single day. It’s compound growth, and once you truly understand it, you’ll never look at progress the same way again.</p>
            <p>I am living this. Running and coding have shown me firsthand how small efforts, stacked over time, can transform not just what I do, but who I am. When I first started running, I was out of shape. I could barely continue without my legs feeling like they were going to fall off. Every step felt like my body was fighting against me. But I laced up my shoes and kept going anyway. One run turned into a week of runs. A week turned into a month. A month turned into 16 months. And without even realizing it, the miles added up, my endurance increased, my mindset shifted. One day, I looked back and realized I wasn’t the same person anymore. I had built something that couldn’t be taken away.</p>
            <p>Coding was the same way. You don’t wake up one day and suddenly master it. It’s writing bad code until it becomes better. It’s struggling with a problem for hours, maybe even days, until something clicks. It’s choosing to show up and get a little better every day, even when you don’t see results. Then one day, what used to feel impossible is second nature. That’s the magic of compound growth—it sneaks up on you.</p>
            <p>Most people never stick with anything long enough to see this transformation. They give up too soon because they don’t see instant results. But here’s the truth: the biggest changes in life don’t announce themselves. They happen quietly, in the moments when no one is watching, when the work feels pointless, when you wonder if any of it is even worth it. And then, suddenly, it all adds up.</p>
            <p>Whatever it is you want—whether it’s to be stronger, smarter, more successful—it doesn’t come from one big leap. It comes from showing up, doing the small things, and trusting the process. Every rep in the gym, every page you read, every extra mile you run, every bug you fix—it’s all stacking up, compounding in ways you can’t see yet. But one day, you will.</p>
            <p>The question isn’t can you change your life? It’s will you commit to the little things long enough to see it happen? Because I promise you—if you do, the results will be bigger than you ever imagined.</p>
