        <h2>When Your Life Truly Begins</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 12, 2025</div>
            <p>There’s a moment—sometimes quiet, sometimes loud—when you wake up and realize that the life you’ve been living isn’t the life you were meant to live. That time has been moving, the days have been passing, and you’ve been existing but not fully living. And then it hits you: Everyone has two lives, and the second one starts the moment you realize you have one.</p>
            <p>I’ve felt this in my soul. That urge that creeps in at night, keeping me awake, whispering that there’s something more. That I was made for something greater. That God didn’t place me here just to survive, but to truly live—to step into the purpose He designed for me. And yet, for so long, I hesitated. Maybe you have too. Maybe you’ve felt the weight of a dream so big it scares you. Maybe you've felt the pull toward something greater but let fear, doubt, or comfort hold you back.</p>
            <p>But God doesn’t put desires in our hearts for no reason. He doesn’t keep us up at night with visions of what could be just to watch us settle for less. No, those thoughts, those restless nights, that feeling deep in your gut—it’s a calling. It’s Him, nudging you toward the life you’re supposed to step into.</p>
            <p>The problem is, we wait. We wait for the right time. We wait for the perfect opportunity. We wait until we feel “ready.” But here’s the truth: there is no perfect time. There is no magic moment where all the fear disappears. Taking that leap—whether it’s chasing a dream, changing your life, or stepping into faith—will always come with uncertainty. But that’s where trust comes in.</p>
            <p>God didn’t design us to live in fear. He calls us to walk by faith, not by sight. He calls us to move even when we don’t see the whole picture. And when we finally take that step—when we stop hesitating and start living—something shifts. We begin to see the world differently. The things that once seemed so important—the opinions, the doubts, the fear of failure—fade in comparison to the fire inside of us.</p>
            <p>And that’s when life truly begins.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to reach the end of my life knowing that I let fear win. That I ignored God’s calling because I was too afraid to step into it. I don’t want to spend my days dreaming but never doing. I want to live boldly, fully, fearlessly. And if you’ve been feeling that same pull—the restless nights, the lingering dreams, the knowing that you were made for more—this is your sign. Stop waiting. Stop doubting. Start living.</p>
            <p>Because this is your second life. And it starts the moment you decide to truly embrace it.</p>
