        <h2>Dose of Growth</h2>
        <p>Life’s greatest transformations come through struggle. Growth is a painful yet necessary process, a fire that refines the strongest metals. You are not defined by your past failures, but by your ability to rise from them.</p>
        <p>Every setback is a lesson. Every failure is fuel. The only question is—how will you use it? Your future self depends on the work you do today. Keep pushing.</p>
