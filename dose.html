        <h2>What If I Never Figure It Out?</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 13, 2025</div>
            <p>I woke up with a heavy heart today. That kind of weight that presses into your chest before your eyes even open. It wasn’t doubt, not exactly. It wasn’t that I didn’t know my purpose—because I do. I know why I’m here, what I’m meant to do, the fire that drives me. But even when you know, even when you’ve seen the vision so clearly, there are days when the path feels clouded. Days when you wonder if you’re doing it right. If you’ll ever reach the version of yourself you see in your mind. If all this work, all this hope, will be enough.</p>
            <p>So I prayed. Not for answers, because I already have them, but for reassurance. For stillness. For the strength to hold onto what I know when my feelings try to convince me otherwise. And after that, I knew I had to put this out, because maybe you’ve felt this too—the weight of knowing your purpose, but still feeling lost in the process of becoming.</p>
            <p>No one talks about how even certainty comes with fear. That even when you know what you were made for, the journey can shake you. That having a purpose doesn’t mean you won’t wake up some days questioning whether you’re on the right track, whether you’re doing enough, whether you’re enough.</p>
            <p>And maybe that’s just part of it. Maybe purpose isn’t this smooth, unwavering thing. Maybe it’s messy and complicated and filled with doubt. Maybe knowing isn’t the same as arriving, and maybe that’s okay. Maybe the weight isn’t a sign that we’re lost, but a reminder that we’re carrying something important. Something heavy. Something meaningful.</p>
            <p>I don’t know what the future looks like. I don’t know how long this road is, or what’s waiting on the other side of the work I’m putting in. But I know one thing: I won’t stop walking. I won’t let the weight convince me that I should put it down. I won’t let the fear of not getting it perfect keep me from getting it done.</p>
            <p>If you’re feeling this too—if you’re sitting in the tension between knowing your purpose and not yet seeing the full picture—don’t let it break you. Let it shape you. Let it remind you that even when the road is uncertain, you are still moving toward exactly where you’re meant to be.</p>
