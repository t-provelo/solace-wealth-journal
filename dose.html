        <h2>You Are Not Your Pain</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 10, 2025</div>
            <p>In order to love yourself, you can’t hate the experiences that shaped you. Read that again. Let it sink in. Because too many of us carry shame for the things we’ve been through, as if the hardest moments of our lives are stains we should hide. But what if I told you that everything—the heartbreak, the loss, the failures, the nights you thought you wouldn’t make it—was never meant to break you? What if it was meant to build you?</p>
            <p>You cannot cherry-pick growth. You cannot demand strength without struggle. Every scar on your heart, every moment that tested you, every single thing you swore you’d never get through—those are the moments that shaped you. And yet, we resent them. We resent the pain, as if it wasn’t the thing that taught us to stand up. We resent the struggle, as if it wasn’t the fire that hardened our resolve. We resent the past, as if we could be who we are today without it.</p>
            <p>But here’s the truth: if you spend your life hating what made you, you will never fully love yourself. Because you are not just the good moments. You are the storms you weathered, the fears you faced, the mountains you climbed when your legs were shaking. And if you can’t make peace with those moments, you will never find peace within yourself.</p>
            <p>It’s easy to wish things had gone differently. To look at the pain and think, If only that never happened, I’d be happier, I’d be stronger, I’d be more successful. But would you? Or would you be softer, less resilient, less capable of handling what life throws at you? The very things you curse may be the same things that gave you depth, wisdom, and the kind of strength that can’t be taught—only earned.</p>
            <p>Loving yourself is not about erasing the past. It’s about owning it. It’s about standing in front of your reflection and saying, I see everything I’ve been through, and I still choose to love the person I’ve become. It’s about understanding that every version of you—the broken, the lost, the scared—deserves compassion, not resentment. Because all of those versions fought for you to be here.</p>
            <p>So don’t just love yourself when things are good. Love yourself for the moments when you were at your lowest, but you kept going anyway. Love yourself for the times you wanted to give up, but something inside you refused. Love yourself for surviving what should have destroyed you.</p>
            <p>Because that’s not weakness. That’s power. And the second you embrace it, nothing—not your past, not your pain, not the voice in your head that tells you you’re not enough—can ever take that away from you.</p>
