        <h2>Wealth Gap & Economic Inequality</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 10, 2025</div>
            <p>Let’s not sugarcoat it—the system is not built for you to win. If you’ve ever felt like you’re running on a treadmill while the wealthy are on an escalator, that’s because you are. The middle class—the foundation of the American Dream—is slowly vanishing, and the wealth gap is turning into a canyon. But here’s the thing: once you understand why this is happening, you can stop playing the losing game.</p>
            <p>Wealth isn’t just about income—it’s about assets. The rich don’t work for money the way most people do. They let money work for them. While the middle class saves what’s left of their paycheck after bills, the wealthy buy assets—stocks, real estate, businesses, intellectual property—that grow without them lifting a finger. And because of that, their wealth compounds over time. If you’re just trading time for money, you’re already behind.</p>
            <p>Then there’s inflation, which isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a silent tax on everyone who isn’t rich. When prices rise, the cost of living eats away at whatever income gains you’ve made. Meanwhile, the wealthy, who own assets that inflate with inflation, see their wealth grow. They own the real estate that gets more expensive. They hold the stocks that rise in value. They invest in businesses that adjust their prices accordingly.</p>
            <p>The government plays its role too—bailing out corporations, printing money, and keeping interest rates high enough to squeeze the everyday person but low enough for the wealthy to borrow and invest. And taxes? The system favors those who know how to use it. The ultra-rich don’t earn wages—they earn capital gains, dividends, and passive income, which are taxed at lower rates. They have businesses, trusts, and loopholes that most people never take the time to understand.</p>
            <p>But let me be clear: complaining about the game won’t change it. You have two choices—get mad, or get smart.</p>
            <p>The middle class is shrinking because the economy is shifting. AI and automation are eliminating jobs. The housing market is locking out new buyers. The stock market is a rollercoaster that rewards those who understand it and punishes those who don’t. If you want to break out, you have to shift with it. Invest, even if it’s small. Build skills that keep you ahead of automation. Find ways to create income that doesn’t depend on an employer. Learn how taxes and investments work, because no one is going to teach you unless you seek it out.</p>
            <p>The wealth gap isn’t going anywhere. The question is—will you be on the losing side of it, or will you figure out how to move differently?</p>
