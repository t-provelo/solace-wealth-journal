        <h2>Hidden Cracks</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 18, 2025</div>
            <p>There’s a quiet storm brewing in the economy, one that won’t make front-page headlines until it’s too late. We talk about recessions like they’re sudden events—one moment, everything is fine, the next, markets collapse. But the truth is, economic downturns don’t happen overnight. They build slowly, like cracks in a foundation, ignored until they can’t be.</p>
            <p>Look around. Inflation may have cooled on paper, but everyday people still feel squeezed. Wages haven’t kept up with real costs, and the middle class—once the backbone of the economy—is getting hollowed out. Meanwhile, corporations continue posting record profits, not because of innovation, but because they’ve mastered the art of squeezing every last drop from workers while keeping prices high. The wealth divide isn’t just growing—it’s solidifying.</p>
            <p>The debt cycle is another silent alarm. The U.S. national debt is soaring past $34 trillion, and consumer debt is following suit. People aren’t living lavishly; they’re financing their survival. Student loans, credit cards, mortgages—debt has become the default, not the exception. The government, like individuals, keeps spending, pushing off the consequences. But at some point, the bill comes due.</p>
            <p>And then there’s the global stage. The U.S. dollar has long been the world’s reserve currency, but we’re seeing cracks in that dominance. Countries are beginning to explore alternatives, trading in other currencies, stockpiling gold, and building alliances that exclude the U.S. If the dollar loses its standing, America’s financial power shrinks with it.</p>
            <p>So what happens next? There are two paths: either we make serious structural changes—rethinking corporate power, addressing income inequality, and investing in the real economy instead of just the stock market—or we continue on this trajectory until something snaps. The scary part? We’ve seen this before. Every empire in history that overextended itself financially, that let wealth concentrate at the top while its people struggled, eventually collapsed under its own weight.</p>
            <p>The system isn’t broken. It’s working exactly as it was designed to—just not in your favor. The question is: how long before people realize it?</p>
