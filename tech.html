        <h2>Quiet War Over Internet Freedom</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 14, 2025</div>
            <p>The internet was once imagined as the great equalizer, a boundless space where information flowed freely, unshackled by borders, governments, or corporate interests. It was supposed to be the closest thing to true freedom humanity had ever created. But as with all things that hold power, control eventually follows. The internet today is no longer the free, open space it once was. Bit by bit, governments and corporations are carving it up, putting up walls, restricting access, and reshaping what was meant to be limitless into something far more controlled.</p>
            <p>China’s Great Firewall is the most obvious and extreme example. A tightly monitored digital landscape where foreign sites like Google, Wikipedia, and Twitter are banned, and only government-approved narratives thrive. Russia has tightened its grip as well, blocking websites critical of its leadership and pressuring tech companies to store user data within its borders. These are the expected players in internet censorship. But what about the ones who claim to be champions of a free web?</p>
            <p>In the United States, the battle over net neutrality exposed how fragile internet freedom really is. The debate wasn’t just about speed throttling or whether companies could charge extra for better service—it was about whether the internet should remain an open playing field or if it would be yet another resource controlled by the highest bidder. The repeal of net neutrality meant internet providers gained more control over what users see, how fast they see it, and how much it costs them. And while the idea of "censorship" in the US may seem distant, the quiet cooperation between tech giants and governments tells a different story. Apple, for example, has removed apps and news sources at the request of authoritarian regimes to maintain access to those markets. Google has, at times, modified search results to comply with foreign censorship laws. Even platforms like Twitter and Facebook, once heralded as free speech megaphones, have been forced to walk a fine line between content moderation and political pressure.</p>
            <p>What we are witnessing is the slow, systematic control of the internet—not through a sudden authoritarian takeover, but through small, calculated moves that restrict access in ways many don’t even notice. The promise of the internet was that it would belong to everyone. That knowledge would not be hoarded, that voices would not be silenced, that borders would not exist in the digital world. Instead, we see a future where the internet is fragmented, where access depends on where you live, what government controls your data, and which corporation holds the keys.</p>
            <p>The real question is whether people will fight to keep the internet open or accept a more restricted digital world. The greatest threat to internet independence isn’t just government censorship or corporate interests—it’s complacency. If people don’t push back, if they don’t demand transparency, privacy, and equal access, then the free internet will not be taken from them; they will give it away.</p>
