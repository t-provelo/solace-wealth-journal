        <h2>Digital Privacy A Myth?</h2>
        <div class="article">
            <div class="byline">By: Terry Roy - Published on March 12, 2025</div>
            <p>The internet knows more about you than you might think. Your home address, phone number, past jobs, and even your family connections are all sitting out there, waiting to be found. Companies, advertisers, and even strangers can pull up a shocking amount of information with just a few clicks. That’s why web cleansing—removing your personal data from public databases—is something more people need to start taking seriously.</p>
            <p>Let’s say you Google yourself and find your address on a site like Whitepages or Spokeo. Maybe your phone number is listed on BeenVerified, or an old email pops up on a leaked database. These aren’t just random pieces of information; they can be used for identity theft, spam, scams, or even doxxing.</p>
            <p>If you’re applying for a new job, a company might run a background check using one of these data broker sites. If a hacker wants to guess security questions for your bank, they might dig through these records to find your mother’s maiden name or your first car. It’s all out there unless you actively remove it.</p>
            <p>To take control, you need to start opting out. Websites like DeleteMe, OneRep, and Incogni work by tracking down your information on these databases and removing it for you. Some of these services require a subscription, but many data brokers also have free opt-out pages—you just have to find them.</p>
            <p>Social media is another major leak. Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram all store personal details that third parties can scrape. Tightening your privacy settings, using a VPN, and even deleting old accounts you no longer use can help minimize your exposure.</p>
            <p>The bottom line? Your personal data is a currency, and companies are profiting from it. If you’re not actively protecting your information, someone else is using it. The internet may feel impossible to control, but you still have power over what’s out there—if you choose to take it.</p>
